My name is Jingwu Tang (唐静吾). I am a second-year PhD student in [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Steven Wu](https://zstevenwu.com/) and Prof. [Fei Fang](https://feifang.info/). Before that, I obtained my bachelor's degree at Turing class, [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). During my undergraduate study, I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Xiaotie Deng](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/people/faculty/xiaotiedeng/index.htm). My research interest lies in machine learning, game theory and algorithms. Most recently, I am working on game learning and sequential decision making.

# More About Me
I love many kinds of sports, including basketball, badminton, jogging (also some track events) and outdoor biking, yet I'm not good at all of them. I'm a big fan of Stephen Curry and Golden State Warriors.
I love reading, especially books about social science and history.
In my spare time, I like to engage in social service that may help someone in need. I spent two years in a school club that helps students in underdeveloped areas of China.

My [Erdős number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number) is 3.
