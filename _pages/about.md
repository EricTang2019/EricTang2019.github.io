My name is Jingwu Tang (唐静吾). I am a senior-year undergrad at Turing Class, Peking University. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Xiaotie Deng](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/people/faculty/xiaotiedeng/index.htm). Since Summer 2022, I have been fortunate to work with Prof. [Steven Wu](https://zstevenwu.com/) at CMU. My research interest broadly lies in differential privacy, algorithmic game theory and machine learning. Most recently, I've been thinking about how to design better mechanisms through machine learning approaches. 

I will join Software and Societal Systems Department at CMU as a Ph.D student in Fall 2023!

# More About Me
I love many kinds of sports, including basketball, badminton, jogging (also some track events) and outdoor biking, yet I'm not good at all of them. I'm a big fan of Stephen Curry and Golden State Warriors.
I love reading, especially books about social science and history.
In my spare time, I like to engage in social service that may help someone in need. I spent two years organizing a school club that helps students of underdeveloped areas in China, and once became a volunteer teacher for 2 weeks.
