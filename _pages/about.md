My name is Jingwu Tang (唐静吾). I am a second-year PhD student in [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Steven Wu](https://zstevenwu.com/) and Prof. [Fei Fang](https://feifang.info/). Before that, I obtained my bachelor's degree at Turing class, [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). During my undergraduate study, I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Xiaotie Deng](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/people/faculty/xiaotiedeng/index.htm). My research interest lies in reinforcement learning, game theory and multi-calibration.

# Others
I highly recommend everyone to explore the special collections in university archives! For instance, I had the opportunity to see and even handle the transcript and photograph John Nash submitted with his Princeton application.

My [Erdős number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number) is 3.
